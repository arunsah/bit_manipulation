|Symbol	        | Function	                | Description |
|  :---:        | :---                      | :--- |
| ~	            | Complement	            | Bit n of ~x is the opposite of bit n of x |
| &	            | Bitwise And	            | Bit n of x&y; is 1 if bit n of x and bit n of y is 1. |
| \|	        | Bitwise Or	            | Bit n of x|y is 1 if bit n of x or bit n of y is 1. |
| ^	            | Bitwise Exclusive Or	    | Bit n of x^y is 1 if bit n of x or bit n of y is 1 but not if both are 1. |
| ^	            | Bitwise Exclusive Or	    | x^y = (x\|y) & !(x&y;) : either x or y but not both |
| >>            | Right Shift (divide by 2) | Bit n of x>>s is bit n-s of x. |
| <<            | Left Shift (multiply by 2)    | Bit n of x<<s is bit n+s of x. |
